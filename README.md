# TranslationTool
A small translation tool for Wildermyth.
For now, I will only offer you an uncompiled version of this tool.

A template for a new translation mod can be found here: https://github.com/JohnnyTendo/TranslationTemplate
Just download the content to a local directory and select that directory when creating a new project. All directories and containing files will then be shown in the project tree.
